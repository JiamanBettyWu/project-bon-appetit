What do you mean by "functional food"?

Why the top 5 foods? Is there any reason you can't find a cutoff based on the
data? Is there any reason you can't talk about more foods? Don't artificially
limit yourself to 5.

How will you detect geographical variations?

"analysis on the underlying trend to explain why this particular food is
popular" -- What does this mean? How will the number of mentions of a
particular food tell you _why_ that food is popular? Isn't popularity somewhat
subjective?

What does the Supermarket API have to do with your project? It appears to
provide information about food prices and other product details. How/what will
it tell you about food trends? If it is not relevant, don't use it!

If your project is about food trends, why haven't you included any major
food-focused websites among your data sources? You will likely need additional
sources to confirm that what you're seeing is a population trend rather than a
trend at a particular newspaper or website (which could be due to editorial
whims).

You should also check that you can get sufficent data from the APIs you listed.
The NYT and WP API may not be free, especially for articles that are more than
a year old.

How/why is identifying food trends from keywords challenging? Is the problem
with identifying words that are actually foods? Can you think of any creative
ways to do this? Can you get lists of food words from somewhere? Once you've
identified the words, is it still challenging to detect trends?

Overall your topic is fine and it seems like your project has appropriate depth.
