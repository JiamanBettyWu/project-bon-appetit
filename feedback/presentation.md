# Presentation Feedback

See Canvas for grade.

* Good introduction
* What aspects of "distribution" are you interested in? First goal is vague
* Spoke loudly and clearly
* The clusters on the map are in unusual places, and you did not really explain
  or acknowledge this during your presentation -- possibly the plot is
  incorrect or something else is at play
* Did you check posting times by timezone? Might help to see trend
* Were food words removed from the word cloud?
* Difficult to see that CA keywords more diverse than WA. In general you may
  want to remove words that are similar across states if you want to emphasize
  the differences.
