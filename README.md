In this project, we analyze restaurants in New York using data gathered from Yelp. Throughout the project, we are motivated by the question: what makes a good restaurant? This is an important question for many reasons. First, companies such as Yelp may want to improve rating systems to provide more accurate and concise information to customers. Customers, in turn, will make more informed decisions. Companies such as Yelp can also use restaurant ratings to return more relevant search results for customers. The fair rating system can also foster a competitive environment among businesses that will incentivize businesses to improve service.
